## History

First came S, the first statistical computing language that was a real
computer language.  It was invented at [Bell Labs](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Bell_Labs&oldid=827987152)
by John Chambers
and co-workers.  Development started in 1975.  It was first distributed
outside of Bell Labs in 1980.  Before 1988, S did not have real functions
(it had macros to do the same job, but nowhere near as well).
A version of S with real functions was released in 1998.

S always was and still is proprietary software.  It is not free as in free
beer nor free as in free speech.  After purchasing it, one can only use it
as the license allows.  The name S is a one-letter name like C
(another language from Bell Labs).  The "S" is for statistics.

In 1988 another company was founded to market S, with additions,
as a proprietary product called S-PLUS (or S+).  It still exists
after several changes of ownership.

Then came R, an implementation of a language very like S.
It was invented at the University of Auckland by Ross Ihaka and Robert
Gentleman.  The name R is a one-letter name like S but is also for
Ross and Robert.  Development started in 1992.  The first stable release
was in 2000.  R is now developed and maintained by the "R Development
Core Team."

R always was and still is free software.  It is free as in free
beer and free as in free speech.  After downloading it for free,
one can only use it as the license allows, but that license allows
you to use it in any way you please and modify it in any way you please,
subject only to the proviso that either you do not distribute your
modifications outside of your organization or you distribute
your modifications under the
same license so that others are also free to use and modify your code
as they please (subject to the same proviso).

One might think that whether software is free or not makes no difference to
ordinary users because they don't want to modify it.  But it makes a very big
difference indirectly.  If anyone anywhere in the world wants to modify R to
solve a problem they have, they can do so, and they can make their solution
available to everyone everywhere if they chose (and according to the license
if they make it available to anyone, then they have to make it available to
everyone).  In contrast, proprietary software only gets features that the
marketing department thinks will have a large enough number of users to make
a profit.  Since R is the only widely used free software statistical computing
language, it has thousands of features that are not in any proprietary
statistical computing language.  So ordinary users may not want to modify R,
but they benefit from the expert users who do want to.

According to an [article in *IEEE Spectrum*](http://spectrum.ieee.org/static/interactive-the-top-programming-languages-2016),
R is the fifth most popular
computer programming language --- not the fifth most popular *statistical*
language but the fifth most popular language overall.  Their top five
were C, Java, Python, C++, and R in that order.  R is (according to them)
almost as popular as C++.  The next most popular language that is vaguely
similar is Matlab in fourteenth place (it is more a numerical analysis language
than a statistics language).  The next most popular statistics language
is SAS in thirty-ninth place.  No other statistical language is on their list,
which ranks forty-nine languages.

Several proprietary companies have been built on R.  In 2007 a company
called Revolution Computing (later called Revolution Analytics, later
sold to Microsoft) was founded to provide support for R and extensions
for R specifically for big data.  In 2011 a company called RStudio provided
a product of the same name that is an integrated development environment for
R (and they also provide other tools for use with R).  Both RStudio and what
used to be Revolution R Open, now Microsoft R Open, are free software.

## CRAN and Bioconductor

Everything R is found at CRAN (https://cran.r-project.org/)
or Bioconductor (https://www.bioconductor.org/).

CRAN is where you get R if you don't already have it or if you need
a new version.
CRAN is also where more than ten thousand contributed extension packages for R
come from (CRAN said "12247 available packages" when I wrote this sentence,
no doubt there are many more now).  Any of these packages can be installed
in seconds with one R command (or by mousing around in the menus in you are
using an R app).  These packages make R very powerful, able to do just about
any statistical analysis anyone has ever thought of.

I have a habit of pronouncing CRAN as cee-ran like CTAN (https://www.ctan.org/) and CPAN (http://www.cpan.org/) after which CRAN is modeled.  But almost
everyone else pronounces it cran as in cranberry.  I am trying to change,
but sometimes forget.

Bioconductor is a smaller site that has many contributed extension packages
for "bioinformatics" (it "only" has 1473 software packages as I write
this sentence).  Bioconductor packages are also easy to install, although
not quite as easy as CRAN packages.

## Manuals

All of the books that are the fundamental R documentation
are free and found at CRAN (under the ["Manuals" link in the navigation](https://cloud.r-project.org/manuals.html)).
We won't use any other books.

The only one of the R manuals that is written for beginners (like you) is
[*An Introduction to R*](https://cloud.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/R-intro.html).
You should take a look
at it.  Anything that you find confusing in class or in the course notes
(like this document) can probably be clarified by looking up the subject
in *An Introduction to R*.

## Other Books

There are now hundreds of books about some statistical topic using R.
As I write, there are 61 books in the "Use R!" series from
Springer, 40 books in the "R series" from Chapman \& Hall/CRC,
and (if I counted correctly) 130 books and videos with "R" in the title
from O'Reilly.
There are more from other publishers.
Many of these books are very good, but we don't recommend any particular one
for this course.

## Why R?

R is the language of choice for statistical computing, at least among
research statisticians and new companies (start-ups and companies that were
recently start-ups like Google, Facebook, Amazon, and the like).  The reasons
are that R is a really developer friendly programming language.  If anyone
anywhere in the world wants to make an R package to do some problem, CRAN
will make it available to everyone everywhere.  And R does not make changes
that break existing code (hardly ever).  So such packages are easy to maintain.
There is nothing like CRAN for competing proprietary statistical computing
languages.  Since R is free software, it is hackable by anyone who is a good
programmer.  It can be made to do anything.  So again, if anyone anywhere in
the world has solved your problem, there is likely a CRAN package to do what
you want.  Or if you are a company with great engineers, they can make R do
whatever the company needs.

In older companies in which statistics has been important for many years
(drug companies, for example) SAS may be what they use.  They've been using
it for decades and don't want to change.  In other academic disciplines
besides statistics, other computing languages may be used for statistics
(SAS, SPSS, Stata, for example),
but R is displacing them more and more.  The reason is that there is so
much available in R that is not available anywhere else.  For example,
the R package `aster` (http://cran.r-project.org/package=aster)
does many forms of
life history analysis that nothing else can do.  So if hundreds of biologists
want to analyze their data, they have to learn R.  The ones that become
good at it then become R advocates.
Similar stories could be told about many kinds of statistical analysis that
are available only in R.

You also hear Python, Perl, Julia, and other dynamic programming languages
recommended for statistics or "data science" but none of these languages
actually have much real statistics available, not even 1% of what is
available on CRAN and Bioconductor.  So they are useful if the
statistics being done is very simple, but not otherwise.

But the main reason we are teaching you R is that is what we know.  As a
statistics major, you are doomed to learn R.

# Some Very Basic Stuff

## Style

Many organizations have "style guides" for the languages their programmers
use.  Many computer languages --- all modern ones, including R --- allow a
great deal of latitude in how one writes.  This can make it difficult
for one programmer to read code written by another.  So, just to make life
easier for everyone, organizations make everyone use the same style.

There are three style guides for R that are somewhat authoritative.
The first two are actual style guides, one by Google
(https://google.github.io/styleguide/Rguide.xml)
and another (http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Style.html),
a modification of the Google guide by Hadley Wickham,
author of the R packages `ggplot2`, `dplyr`, and many more
(collectively called the Hadleyverse) and Chief Scientist at RStudio
(https://www.rstudio.com/).
The other is the source code of R by the R Development Core Team.
(Go to https://cran.r-project.org/ and download the source
code for the current version.  I am not actually suggesting you do this now.
Reading R source code is not easy.  You will have to do that eventually to
become an R guru, if you want to be one.  But not yet.)

## Commands

R commands do not need semicolons.  R commands are terminated by newlines
if they are syntactically complete.  Otherwise they continue on the next line.
```{r, label="semicolons-one"}
2 + 2
2 +
2
(2
+ 2)
```

You can use semicolons to put a lot of R commands on one line, but don't
(the Google R style guide recommends against this).
```{r label="semicolons-two"}
2 + 2; pi; "argle bargle"
```

## Assignment

Use `<-` for assignment, not `=`.  Yes, the former is harder to
type, but R from the most authoritative sources uses the former (including
the R sources).  The assignment operator for R and the S language that
preceded it was `<-` for decades before John Chambers
decided
to add `=` to make the C++ programmers happy, which of course it didn't
(actually I have no idea what his motivation was).
The style guides and the R source code do not agree with Chambers.

Strangely, `->` is also an assignment operator.  There is also a function
`assign`.  There are also `<<-` and `->>` operators.
```{r label="assign"}
foo <- 2
foo
foo = 3
foo
4 -> foo
foo
foo <<- 5
foo
6 ->> foo
foo
assign("foo", 7)
foo
```
All of these do exactly the same thing in this context.  In other contexts,
they do different things.
Inside function bodies, the assignments with the double headed arrows do
something different, which we won't explain here.
The `assign` function with
optional arguments allows the most flexibility in assignment and the most
precise specification of where the assignment is done, and we won't explain
that here either.

In short, use `<-` for assignment.

## Autoprinting

An R command that is not an assignment and is executed at the top level
(not inside a function) automatically prints the value of
the expression.  So the way to see what an R object is, is just to make
that object by itself an R command.
```{r label="nonass"}
x <- 1
x
```
If the object is way too big to worth looking at, the R functions
`head`, `tail`, and `summary`, may be helpful.
```{r label="nonass-too"}
x <- rnorm(10000)
head(x)
tail(x)
summary(x)
```

This feature is called autoprinting, and, though it seems very simple,
it is actually rather complicated.   It can be changed by using the
R function `invisible`, which makes what would ordinarily print
not print, and it actually works by hidden calls to the R function
`print` or `show` (for S4 objects), which are generic functions,
so what gets printed is appropriate for the type of object.
That explanation may make no sense at this point, more about this later.
[Section 1.6 of *R Internals*](https://cloud.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/R-ints.html#Autoprinting)
explains (but that reference also makes no sense to beginners).

Summary: assignment commands don't print their values and other commands do.

This does not mean that assignment expressions don't have values.  They do.
That's why
```{r label="double assign"}
x <- y <- 2
x
y
```
works.

## Whitespace

As in C and C++, whitespace is mostly not needed in R.  There are a few places
where if things were run together, it would change the meaning, but not many.
So one can write
```{r label="whitespace"}
x <- 2
x<-2
```
but the style guides recommend using white space to make it easier for people
to read, whether the computer needs it or not.

## Objects

> To understand computations in R, two slogans are helpful:
>
> * Everything that exists is an object.
> * Everything that happens is a function call.
>
> --- John Chambers, quoted in Section 6.3 of *Advanced R* by Hadley Wickham

In R everything is an *object*.  This is a triviality.  The technical
term used to refer to R thingummies is *object*.

## Object-Oriented Programming

By calling thingummies "objects" this does not mean we are doing
*object-oriented programming* (OOP) that you may have heard about
in your C++ class.  R objects are not like C++ objects.  In R *everything*
is an object.  In C++ only very special things that are instances of C++
classes created with the C++ `new` operator are objects.  In R,
numbers, functions, bits of the R language (R expressions) are also objects.
In C++ those things are definitely not objects.  The C programming language
doesn't have any objects at all, either in the C++ sense or the R sense.

R is not a particularly OOPy language.  It does have three different OOP
systems in the R core (the stuff you get without having to attach a package).
And it has several more OOP systems in packages found in contributed extension
packages on CRAN.
But none of these OOP systems act like the C++ OOP system.
Moreover none of the OOP systems are necessary to most R programming.
Most R programming is not OOPy.

So forget what you learned about OOP in your C++ course.  It won't help you
with R.

## Dynamic

R is a *dynamic* programming language.  This means two things.

 1. Any name can be assigned objects of any type.  Unlike C and C++
    you do not have to "declare" what type of object goes with each name.

 2. You don't compile in the sense that you compile C and C++.  You can
    just type or cut-and-paste R commands into the R program and see what
    happens.

This makes R infinitely easier to program than C/C++.

Nevertheless,  R is just as powerful a language as C++.  It is not as powerful
as C.  You can write operating systems (Windows, OS X, Linux) in C but not
in any other so-called high level language.

## Reproducibility

Although you can type or cut-and-paste R commands into the R program
and see what happens,
you shouldn't when doing serious work.  Put all of your R in a file,
and run
it in a clean R environment.  The command to do this from an operating
system command line is
```
R CMD BATCH --vanilla foo.R
```
Here `foo.R` is the file with the R commands.
A file called `foo.Rout` will be produced.  All of the R commands
in `foo.R` will be executed and all of the results will go
into `foo.Rout`.

Except for randomness in random numbers used
(and this can be removed by setting random number generator seeds, about
which more later), this is 100\% reproducible.  Throwing code at the
interpreter is not reproducible
unless you deliberately start R so the global environment
is empty and type in *exactly* the same commands every time.
`R CMD BATCH` is much more reproducible.  We will insist that
assignments use `R CMD BATCH` or something else 100\% reproducible
(R markdown, for example).

## Help

The R function `help` gives you the somewhat inappropriately named
help on a subject (usually on a function or on a dataset, but help on other
things also exists).  Many people do not find this help helpful.  It depends
on what you are looking for.

R help pages are modeled after unix man pages.  They are supposed to be
complete, concise, and correct.  Most computer "help" outside of R help
pages or unix man pages is none of these things.  It tries to be helpful
and friendly and thus omits lots of things (not complete), belabors what it
does cover (not concise), and dumbs down things to the point of being wrong
(not correct).  Many people nevertheless find this stuff helpful.  Again,
it depends on what you are looking for.

R help pages, on the other hand,
do correctly answer all questions you might have.  But sometimes the answers
are so terse, you may not understand them.
They are thus useful only when you know the basics of the subject but need
to know some technical detail that you either forgot or never new.
*Exactly* what does this function do?
*Exactly* what is the name of some argument to this function?
Questions like that.
R help pages do not give any background.  They do not tell you why or when
you might want to use a function.

For background, you need a book, perhaps *Introduction to R*, perhaps
some other book.  In between help pages and books, are package vignettes,
which not all packages have.  For example, in the CRAN package `mcmc`
(http://cran.r-project.org/package=mcmc)
there are several vignettes; the main one that shows
basic use of the package is shown by the R commands
```
library(mcmc)
vignette("demo", "mcmc")
```
(We cannot show the output of this command in this document because
R displays the output in a separate window.  But if you do this
interactively, it will work.  This applies to many commands in this section.)

As an example of using help, I had to do `help(vignette)` because
I can never remember whether this function is named `vignette` or
`vignettes` or even how to spell it.  Moreover, I did not remember
the order of the arguments or their names, so I needed the help for that too.

To see all the vignettes for this package do
```
library(mcmc)
vignette(package = "mcmc")
```

There is another command `help.search` that may be useful when
you do not know the name of the function (or other thing) that you want
help for.  For example
```
help.search("help")
```
returns a list of R functions that have "help" in their help page
titles or names.  Some of these are involved in the R help system
(including `help.search` itself); others are not.

R has two shorthands for getting help.
```
?whatever
??whatever
```
are shorthand for
```
help(whatever)
help.search(whatever)
```
(The reason for the lack of quotation marks in these examples is explained
in the following section).

## Non-standard Evaluation

Some R functions use what some call "non-standard evaluation,"
(a term apparently coined by Hadley Wickham (http://adv-r.had.co.nz/).
Instead of just evaluating their arguments, they play tricks with some of them.

This "playing tricks" is possible because R expressions are R objects too.
So R can look at them and try to understand them and not just evaluate them.

An example of this is when you do a plot and do not specify labels for
the horizontal and vertical axes, R makes up some labels from the expressions
that specify the horizontal and vertical coordinates of the points plotted.

Another example is help.
```
help("ls")
help(ls)
?ls
?"ls"
```
all do the same thing (show the help for the R function named `ls`).
But
```
help("function")
help(function)
?function
?"function"
```
do not all do the same thing.  The ones without quotation marks are
an error and an incomplete R statement, neither of which shows the help page.
What is going on here?

The non-standard evaluation here is inside the R function named `help`.
Before that function is even invoked, the R interpreter (the part of the R
program that actually executes R commands) must parse the command.
The text `help(function)` is not a valid
R statement because `function` is a keyword that must be followed by
a function definition.  So an error occurs before the R function named
`help` can try to do its trick of working whether or not there
are quotation marks.  The problem is similar with `?function` except
here since nothing follows `function` the R interpreter realizes that
you could follow this with a definition of a function, so it just prints the
prompt for a continuation line.  And, of course, this has nothing to do with
what you wanted (help for the function named `function`).

The example of the R help system, shows that non-standard evaluation is
sometimes problematic.  When in doubt, use the quotation marks.

A lot of R is like this.  R does a lot of tricky things that are helpful
most of the time (omitting quotation marks saves two whole keystrokes when
getting help) but when it is not helpful, it is *seriously* unhelpful.

In programming, one should never use non-standard evaluation unless that is
what has to be done to get the job done.
For example, inside a function you are writing, you may need
to assure that a package is loaded,  The function for this is named
`require`.  And it plays non-standard evaluation tricks just like
`help`.  Both
```{r label="require",eval=FALSE}
require(mcmc)
require("mcmc")
```
work.  But you should only use the latter in programs you write.

The ability of R to do computing on the language is remarkable
and far beyond what most computer languages can do (only LISP and Scheme
are comparable).  So the fact that R can do non-standard evaluation is
a good thing.  The fact that non-standard evaluation
can be used where not helpful does not
automatically make it bad.  Only that particular use is (arguably) bad.
It probably should not have been used in the R functions `help`
and `help.search`, but it is too late to change that now.

# Functions

## Functional Programming

R is a *functional* programming language.  This means that functions
are first class objects that you can do anything with that you could do to
any other object.  You can assign them to variable names, or you can assign
them to be parts of compound objects (like lists), or you can use them as
arguments or values of other functions.

In this one respect, R is exactly like Haskell or Javascript
or F\# or Clojure or Ruby
or other functional programming languages.  In other aspects, R is
very different from those languages.

> This [closures] is the best idea in the history
> of programming languages.
>
> --- Douglas Crockford

Crockford was talking about Javascript, but R has the same idea.  It is
the function named `function`, which creates functions.  Technically,
they are called "closures" for reasons to be explained later.
```{r label="closure"}
typeof(function(x) x)
```

In this respect R is different from and better than S.
The R function named `function` works creates true closures,
where S and S-PLUS did not,
as explained in 
[Section 3.3.1 of the R FAQ](https://cloud.r-project.org/doc/FAQ/R-FAQ.html#Lexical-scoping).

## Pure Functional Programming

In a *pure* functional programming language, functions do not have side
effects.  If called with the same values for the same arguments, they must
always produce the same results.

There are very few totally pure functional programming languages
because they cannot vary what they do to adjust to the outside world.
They cannot do input or output, they cannot do random numbers, they
cannot tell the time or date.  And so forth.  R isn't totally pure either.

But it is more or less pure as far as computation goes.  Unlike C and C++
functions, R functions cannot change the values of their arguments.
In R there is
only one kind of argument (R object).  There is none of this nonsense
about pointers and references.  In C, you can write a function that changes
its argument (or more precisely what its argument points to)
```
void bar(int *x)
{
    *x = 2;
}
```
when you call it as follows
```
int one = 1;
bar(&one);
```
after the call to `bar` returns, the value of `one` is 2.

In C++ the above also works (because almost all C is also valid C++) but
the following also works
```
void baz(int& x)
{
    x = 2;
}
```
when you call it as follows
```
int one = 1;
baz(one);
```
after the call to `baz` returns, the value of `one` is 2.

In R nothing like this is possible the way R functions are commonly
programmed.
```{r label="no-side-effects"}
ralph <- function(x) {
    x <- 2
    return(x)
}
x <- 1
ralph(x)
x
```
Inside the function, the value of `x` is changed to 2, but outside
the function the value of `x` is unchanged by the function.
There are two variables named `x` one inside the function and one
outside.  This is just like C or C++ functions that have non-pointer,
non-reference arguments.  The C or C++ function
```
int ralph(int x)
{
    x = 2;
    return x;
}
```
behaves just like our R function of the same name above.

  R environments and R reference classes, which are syntactic
sugar over environments, are exceptions.  But they are little used.
(At least they are rarely used explicitly.  A new environment is involved
in every function definition and every function invocation.
More on this later.)

The vast majority of R functions cannot change their arguments the way
C and C++ functions can.  This makes R much easier for programmers to program,
and, more importantly, *much easier for users to use*.  The only
way an ordinary R function that does not do I/O or use random numbers can
have an effect on the world outside itself is to return a value.

Every time a function that does not do input, use random numbers, or access
the date, time, process ID, or some such thing (all of which are forms of input)
is called with the same values of the same arguments, it will return the same
result.  In short, it is *pure functional*.  Thus *pure functional*
is the normal style of R programming.  Use it, don't try to fight it.

If you need to return lots and lots of stuff, then put it in a list (which
makes it one R object), and return that.  That's what model fitting functions
like `lm` and `glm` do.  It is a very common R design pattern.
More on this later.

## Functions Assigned Names

Here are some examples of R being a functional programming language.
```{r label="fun1"}
fred <- function(x, y) x + y
fred(2, 3)
```
Never mind that this is just a toy example (we don't need a function
for addition, we already have one).  This shows the idiomatic way to define
a function in R, at least a one-liner.  A function that needs multiple lines
of code for its implementation needs curly brackets around the body of the
function
```{r label="fun2"}
fred <- function(x, y) {
   x <- cos(x)
   y <- exp(y)
   x + y
}
fred(2, 3)
```
But unlike in C and C++, the curly brackets are not needed for one-liners.

How does the function know what value to return?  It returns the value
of the last expression it evaluates, in the examples above the value of
`x + y`.

The R function `return` immediately returns a value from a function
(and no further code in the function body is executed).  So we could have
written
```{r label="fun3"}
fred <- function(x, y) return(x + y)
fred(2, 3)
```
if we wanted our function to look more like C/C++.  But it still doesn't
really look like C or C++ because in them `return` is a keyword
(part of the syntax of the language) not
a function so one could write `return x + y` without parentheses.
In R that is invalid.

Unlike in C or C++, an R function cannot *not* return a value.
Many R functions seem to not return a value, but they do.
```{r label="fun4", fig.keep="none"}
sally <- plot(1:10, 2:11)
sally
```
If a function cannot think of anything better to return, it can return
`invisible(NULL)`.  That means it returns the R object `NULL` and
that object does not get printed when the value is not assigned so users
don't see it and can imagine that it doesn't exist.

But every function returns a value.  Many R functions that ordinary users think
don't return values (because they never see them and don't wonder about them)
actually return objects with useful stuff in them.  We won't worry about that
now.  Just keep it in mind: every R function returns a value (which is an R
object).

Just one more example illustrating that the R function `return`
returns immediately:
```{r label="fun5"}
fred <- function(x, y) {
   x <- cos(x)
   y <- exp(y)
   return(x + y)
   cat("just something here that can never get executed\n")
}
fred(2, 3)
```

## Functions as Arguments to Functions

R functions can be arguments to other R functions.  The R function
`optimize` optimizes functions of one (scalar) variable.
Its first argument is the function to optimize, and the second is an interval
over which to minimize it.
```{r label="funopt1"}
fred <- function(x) exp(x) - log(x)
optimize(fred, c(0.1, 10))
```
If we look at a plot done by the following code
```{r label=fig1code, eval=FALSE}
curve(fred, from = 0.1, to = 10, log = "y")
```
which is
```{r label=fig1, fig.cap="Graph of Mathematical Function Computed by R Function fred", echo=FALSE, fig.align = "center"}
curve(fred, from = 0.1, to = 10, log = "y")
```
we can see that `optimize` seems to have found the solution.
We used a log scale for the vertical axis because otherwise we wouldn't
be able to see where the minimum was (try the same without `log = "y"`).

This is a very common design pattern in R.  There is a function
`integrate` that does integrals of R functions.  There is a
function `uniroot` that finds zeros (roots) of R functions.
In the recommended package `boot`
(which comes with every R installation)
there is a function `boot`
that simulates the approximate sampling distribution of an arbitrary statistic
specified by an R function using the nonparametric bootstrap.
In the CRAN package `mcmc` (http://cran.r-project.org/package=mcmc)
there is a
function `metrop` that simulates random vectors having probability
density function
specified by an R function.  Many other functions use this pattern.
To specify a function, use an R function.  To tell another R function
about this function, pass this function as an argument to that function.

The R functions of the apply family
(`apply`, `eapply`, `lapply`,
`mapply`, `rapply`, `sapply`, `tapply`,
and `vapply`), and those of the higher-order function family
(`Filter`, `Map`, and `Reduce`)
all take an argument that is an R function that they apply to
components of an object.  Also `sweep` and `outer` do this.
In functional programming, a function that takes a function as an argument
or returns another function as its value
is called a *higher-order function*.
(I didn't know about some of these until I looked them up to make this
list.)
Eventually, we will learn about all of these, but not right now.

## Anonymous Functions

R functions don't need names.  The R function whose name is `function`
makes functions.  They don't need to be assigned to names to work.
If we don't bother to give a function a name, the jargon widely used
in functional programming is that we are using an *anonymous function*.
We can redo the preceding example using an anonymous function.
```{r label=funopt2}
optimize(function(x) exp(x) - log(x), c(0.1, 10))
```
This is just the preceding example with the expression defining `fred`
plugged in where `fred` was passed as an argument to `optimize`.
In general, anyplace you can use an R object, you can also use an expression
defining that object.

You don't need to do things like this very often,
```{r label=wtf-one}
(function(x) exp(x) - log(x))(2.7)
```
but it does work.  Here an anonymous function is being evaluated at the
argument value 2.7.  The parentheses around the function definition are
necessary to make the whole function definition something we can apply
the function invocation parentheses to.

# Vectors

In R all of the objects that "hold stuff" are vectors.  There are no objects
that can hold only one number or only one character string.
You may think there are, but those objects are really vectors.
```{r label=one}
one <- 1
one
is.vector(one)
length(one)
```
Why does R print
```
[1] 1
```
and
```
[1] TRUE
```
for these results?  (The `##` in front of output is a foible of the
R package `knitr` and also of `rmarkdown` which uses `knitr` that
I am using to make this document.  It doesn't
appear when you are using R yourself.)

If a vector takes many lines to print, each line starts with the index of
the first component of the vector to appear on that line.
```{r label=many}
1:40
```
As we can see, the R binary operator `:` makes sequences.
As we can also see, R uses one-origin indexing like FORTRAN rather than
zero-origin indexing like C and C++.

R vectors come in two kinds.  In *atomic vectors* all of the components
have to have the same type.  In *lists* the components can be
of different types.

## Types

The types an R atomic vector can have are (table from
[Section 2.1.1 of the *R Language Definition*](https://cloud.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/R-lang.html#Vector-objects))

typeof      mode        storage.mode
----------  ----------  ----------
logical     logical     logical
integer     numeric     integer
double      numeric     double
complex     complex     complex
character   character   character
raw         raw         raw

The column headings are the names of R functions (`typeof`,
`mode`, and `storage.mode`) and the entries are what they
say about various kinds of atomic objects.  There is one other R function
of this kind, `class` that also gives useful information about R
objects.

### Numeric

```{r label="type-one"}
one <- 1
typeof(one)
mode(one)
storage.mode(one)
class(one)
```
The result of `storage.mode` is what C and C++ think of as the type.
Type `"double"` means it is stored as a C or C++ `double`.

One might ask, why is R storing the integer 1 as a double?  And the answer
is sometimes it does.  For the most part R users (even knowledgeable users)
do not need to distinguish between integers and doubles
(between "fixed point" and "floating point" numbers).  The R functions
`mode` and `class` don't distinguish, reporting `"numeric"`
for both.

\pagebreak[3]
Let's try another.
```{r label="type-two"}
lone <- length(one)
typeof(lone)
mode(lone)
storage.mode(lone)
class(lone)
```
For some reason, the R function `length` returns its result as
numbers of type
`"integer"`.  So we see R really does have two kinds of numbers.
But, as we said above, most users never notice the difference and don't
need to notice.

This is different from C and C++ which have an insane assortment of numbers.
They have three floating point types (`float`, `double`, and
`long double`) and I don't know how many integer types (`char`,
`short`, `int`, `long`, and `long long`, and
all of these with `unsigned` in front, like `unsigned char`,
and maybe some I forgot about).  In R we don't worry about any of this.
For the most part R numbers are just numbers, and we won't say any more about
them until we discuss computer arithmetic.

### Complex

The `"complex"` type is what you'd expect.
```{r label="type-three"}
typeof(sqrt(-1))
```
Hmmmmm.  That didn't work.  Let's try again.
```{r label="type-four"}
typeof(sqrt(-1+0i))
```
What did they do?
```{r label="type-five"}
sqrt(-1)
sqrt(-1+0i)
```
Apparently, R only thinks that $\sqrt{- 1} = i$ when you tell it that you
are working with complex numbers by specifying $- 1$ as a complex number,
`-1+0i` in R notation.  Otherwise, it says that square roots of negative
numbers do not exist.  The result `NaN` stands for "not a number".
We will learn more about it when we get to computer arithmetic.
This behavior is useful in statistics, most of the time,
because we don't use complex numbers much.

### Logical

In R the two logical values `TRUE` and `FALSE` are special
values different from any numbers.  `TRUE` and `FALSE` are
not R objects but keywords.
The technical term in R for words that are part of the R syntax and cannot
be variable names is "reserved word" rather than "keyword".  To see
the documentation on them, do `?Reserved` or `help(Reserved)`.

R, for backwards compatibility with its
predecessor S, also understands `T` and `F` as synonyms,
but you should never use them.  The difference is that `T` and
`F` are not keywords but just R objects that can be redefined,
and that will wreak havoc if you are expecting them to behave as logical
values.
```{r label="type-six"}
typeof(TRUE)
typeof(T)
T <- "spaghetti"
typeof(T)
```
If you try
```{r label="type-true-error", error=TRUE}
TRUE <- "spaghetti"
```
you will find that you can't do that.  `TRUE`
is a keyword and cannot be the name of an R object.

This is very different from ancient C and C++ which did not have logical
types.  Instead they used zero or types convertible to zero like null pointers
as their equivalent of `FALSE`, and everything else as their equivalent
of `TRUE`.  Modern C and C++ do have what they call "Boolean" types,
they are new and not used by all programmers.

Always use `TRUE` and `FALSE`.
Never use `T` and `F` instead.

### Character

Type `"character"`, also called "string" by some (probably because of
the influence of C and C++), we have already seen.  Here is another example.
```{r label="type-seven"}
LETTERS
```

### Raw

Type `"raw"` cannot be constructed in R.  It is there for the use of
C or C++ functions called from R.  They can return objects of type
`"raw"` that R does not understand and cannot use.  They can only be
passed to C or C++ functions called from R that understand them.
So we won't pay any more attention to this type.

## Atomic Vectors

We have already seen atomic vectors (since R has no scalars, every object
that may have looked like a scalar is really an atomic vector).  So nothing
more needs to be said except that R vectors are much smarter than C vectors.
Like C++ objects of class `std::vector` they know their own size and
type.  (In general, every R object knows lots of things about itself).
Unlike C++ vectors, R vectors don't have methods.  Instead there are functions
that work on them.  (This is because all of this goes back before R to S
before it had OOP.)
```{r label=vector}
length(LETTERS)
head(LETTERS)
tail(LETTERS)
length(colors())
head(colors())
tail(colors())
length(1:20)
length(double())
```
R is just fine with vectors of length zero.

## Vectors, Operators, and Functions

Since every R object that holds stuff
(not functions, expressions, and the like) is a vector, operators and functions
have to deal with that.  Since S and R have had this "everything is a vector"
from their beginnings, every function and operator knows how do deal
with vectors (at least each knows its own special way to deal with vectors).

### Componentwise with Recycling

Many mathematical functions deal with vectors the same way.  If the operands
or arguments are vectors of the same length, they work componentwise.
```{r label="vectorize-one"}
1:5 + 6:10
1:5 * 6:10
1:5 ^ 6:10
```
Oops!  That last wasn't what we meant.
```{r label="vectorize-two"}
(1:5)^(6:10)
```

And many functions work the same
```{r label="vectorize-three"}
dnorm(1:5, 6:10, 11:15)
```
If we look up what this function does (`?dnorm`), we find that it
calculates the probability density function of normal distributions;
it calculates $f_{\mu, \sigma}(x)$, where the arguments to `dnorm`
are $x$, $\mu$, and $\sigma$ in that order.  The call above is the same as
```{r label="vectorize-four"}
dnorm(1, 6, 11)
dnorm(2, 7, 12)
dnorm(3, 8, 13)
dnorm(4, 9, 14)
dnorm(5, 10, 15)
```
except for being five commands rather than one.

When the arguments are different lengths, these operators and functions still
work.  When one of the arguments is length one, these do what you'd expect.
```{r label="vectorize-five"}
1:5 + 2
1:5 * 2
(1:5)^2
dnorm(1:5, 2, 2)
```

This is a special case of a more general rule called the *recycling rule*.

 * If the operands or arguments are vectors of different lengths,
   then the length of the result is the length of the longest operand
   or argument.
 * Each operand or argument is extended to this length by recycling:
   for example an operand `1:2` is extended to length 5 as the vector
   with components 1, 2, 1, 2, 1.

This can be very confusing.
```{r label="vectorize-confuse"}
dnorm(1:2, 1:3, 1:5)
dnorm(1, 1, 1)
dnorm(2, 2, 2)
dnorm(1, 3, 3)
dnorm(2, 1, 4)
dnorm(1, 2, 5)
```
Sometimes R gives a warning about this kind of confusion.
```{r label="vectorize-confuse-too"}
1:2 + 1:3
```
and sometimes it doesn't (as we saw above with `dnorm`).

I don't recommend you use confusing recycling.  If you do, put in a comment
to explain.

### Reduce

There is another common design pattern where functions take a vector and
produce a number
```{r label=reduce}
sum(1:5)
prod(1:5)
max(1:5)
min(1:5)
```

There is even a higher-order function `Reduce` that uses this design
pattern with an arbitrary function.
```{r label="reduce-reduce"}
Reduce("+", 1:5, 0)
Reduce(function(x, y) if (x > y) x else y, 1:5, -Inf)
```
(the first does the same as `sum`, the second does the same
as `max`).

### Ifelse

Since every R object is a vector (except for those that aren't).  One
should use this feature of the language as much as possible.  In R,
iteration (`for` and `while` loops) is used much less than
in C and C++.  A lot of iteration can be replaced by functions that operate
on vectors (as all R functions have no choice but to do).

For example, `sum` does sums without a loop, and `Reduce`
does this for any operation.  The functions in the apply family (listed in
[Section 4.4](#functions-as-arguments-to-functions)
above allow the design
pattern of componentwise calculation with recycling to be applied with
arbitrary functions.

The R function `ifelse` allows the if-then-else design pattern to be
applied vectorwise.
```{r label=ifelse}
x <- rnorm(6)
x
ifelse(x < 0, x - 3, x + 3)
x + 3 * sign(x)
```

## Indexing

R has four (!)\ different ways to "index" vectors (extract subvectors, or
otherwise refer to subvectors).

 * vector of positive integers
 * vector of negative integers
 * logical vector
 * character vector

Indexing is also sometimes called subscripting.  Because vector indices are
often denoted as subscripts in mathematics.  For example, `?Subscript`
gives the help for the indexing operators, but so does `?Extract`, which
is the official name of this help page (`Subscript` is an "alias").

### Indexing with Positive Integers

```{r label="index-one"}
LETTERS[7]
```
But here as everywhere else what would be a scalar in C or C++ can be a
vector in R
```{r label="index-two"}
LETTERS[2 * 1:7 - 1]
```
So that illustrates the first type (positive integer vector).

### Indexing with Negative Integers

```{r label="index-three"}
LETTERS[- (2 * 1:7 - 1)]
```
(This would be different if we omitted the parentheses.)
Negative indices indicate components to omit.  The result is
all of the components except the ones whose indices are the positive
integers corresponding to these negative integers.

### Index Zero?

```{r label="index-zero"}
LETTERS[0:5]
```
Apparently zero is just ignored in an integer index vector.

### Indexing with Logicals

```{r label="index-four"}
LETTERS[seq(along = LETTERS) %% 2 == 1]
```
The logical expression indicates odd indices.  We see a bunch of new stuff
here.  The R function `seq` makes sequences more complicated than the
`:` operator can make, although we could replace this with
```{r label="index-five"}
LETTERS[1:length(LETTERS) %% 2 == 1]
```
The `%%` operator calculates remainders (from division, in this case
division by 2).  As in C and C++, the operator for logical equality
is `==`.

\pagebreak[3]
We could also do this more simply with
```{r label="index-five-and-a-half"}
LETTERS[seq(1, length(LETTERS), 2)]
```
but that wouldn't illustrate logical indexing.

### Indexing with Character Strings

The fourth kind of indexing (with a character vector)
doesn't work unless the R object we are taking
components out of has names.  So let's give our example names.
```{r label="index-six"}
names(LETTERS) <- letters
LETTERS[c("d", "o", "g")]
```
The R function `c` "concatenates" (pastes together) vectors
to make one vector.

Here we see a very powerful feature of R.  Some functions can appear on
the left-hand side of an assignment.  Actually (technical quibble!),\ the
function being called in the example above is not named `names` but
rather is named `names<-`
```{r label="names-left-hand-side"}
get("names<-")
```
but most R users don't know that and don't need to know that.  They just
"know" that `names` can be used on either side of an assignment.

The R documentation encourages this way of thinking.  From the help page
for these functions, which one gets by `?names` or `help(names)`,
```
Usage:

     names(x)
     names(x) <- value
```

Indexing also works on the left-hand side of an assignment.
```{r label="index-seven"}
LETTERS[seq(along = LETTERS) %% 2 == 1] <- "woof"
LETTERS
```

The R objects `LETTERS` and `letters` are, like `T`
and `F` and `pi` and some other things, already defined when you
start R (all of the predefined constants, have the same help page, so
asking for the help for any one of them shows all of them).

When we started redefining `LETTERS` we made a new variable
in our global environment (what R calls where it keeps objects you give names
by assignment).  But the objects with the same names defined by R are still
there hidden by our assignments (they are in another place, more on this
later).  We can see them again by removing ours.
```{r label="index-eight"}
rm(LETTERS)
LETTERS
```
This is the magic of R environments.  More on this later.

## Type Coercion

R, like C and C++ does a lot of *type coercion* (changing variable of
one type into another behind your back).  Since R has fewer types than C and
C++, its type coercion is (slightly) less crazy that C/C++'s.

The most useful is coercion of logical to numeric in arithmetic contexts.
For example,
```{r label="coercion"}
x <- rnorm(100)
sum(x < 0)
```
counts how many components of `x` are negative.
[Section 2.4 of *Introduction to R*](https://cloud.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/R-intro.html#Logical-vectors)
explains this.

Sometimes useful and sometimes not is automatic coercion of all kinds of
objects to character in character contexts.
```{r label="coercion-too"}
foo <- 1:10
names(foo) <- foo + 100
foo
class(names(foo))
letters[1:3] <- rnorm(3)
letters[1:10]
```

The first is arguably useful.  The latter may do more harm than good.
The character conversions are explained in
[Section 2.6 of *Introduction to R*](https://cloud.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/R-intro.html#Character-vectors).

Coercions can also be performed by explict use of functions.
```{r label="coercion-too-too"}
as.character(1:5)
as.numeric(letters[1:5])
as.logical(0:5)
```

Here my claim that R help pages are complete, concise, and correct is wrong
(in versions of R up to and including 3.4.4, but I have reported this as a
bug so it presumably will be fixed in future versions of R; one member
of the R core team commented on the bug that the information was in
`?Logic` but apparently nowhere else).

The help page for `as.logical` (in version 3.4.3 and before)
does not say what it does when the
argument is numeric.  It appears to be following the way of C and C++,
converting zero
to `FALSE` and everything else to `TRUE` except for `NA`
or `NaN` which are left as (logical) `NA`.
```{r label="coercion-na"}
foo <- as.integer(c(0:5, NA))
foo
as.logical(foo)
foo <- c(0:5, pi, NA, NaN)
# has to be type double if contains pi
foo
as.logical(foo)
```



## Lists

Vectors that are not atomic can hold different types of R object.
They are created by the R function named `list`.
```{r label="show-list"}
sally <- list(color = "red", number = pi,
    method = function(x, y) x + y)
sally
```
And they are generally called lists.

## More On Indexing

With lists there are two kinds of indexing.
All of what we saw in [Section 5.4](#indexing) above works on lists.
But for lists there is also another entirely different kind, or perhaps
two entirely different kinds, depending on how you count.

```{r label="list-index-one"}
sally[3]
```
makes a list whose single component is the third component of `sally`.
That is often not what we want, so there is another kind of indexing using
double square brackets.
```{r label="list-index-two"}
sally[[3]]
```
See the difference?

 * `sally[3]` is a list having one element named `method`,
    which is a function.
 * `sally[[3]]` is that function.

Hence `sally[3]` is equal to `list(sally[[3]])`.

The reason why we need both kinds (single square brackets
and double square brackets) is that you usually (?) want what double square
brackets does, but that doesn't always work.
```{r label="list-index-three", error=TRUE}
sally[2:3]
sally[[2:3]]
```
I didn't know what would happen with the latter until
I tried it, but the documentation says double square brackets indexing
can only select a single component (the argument must be a vector of length
one).  Since these are operators the documentation is a bit hard to find.
You need to quote bits of syntax to see the documentation.  For double square
brackets `?"[["` or `help("[[")` does the job.  The same goes
for other reserved words: `?"function"` or `help("function")` is
the way to see the documentation for the function named `function`.

One can also use the `$` operator instead of the `[[` operator
if the list has names and if the name in question is a valid R name (also
called symbol).  `?name` shows the documentation for that, except it
doesn't tell you what the valid names are.  For some strange reason,
`?make.names` does tell you what the valid names are.

So
```{r label="list-index-four"}
sally$method
sally[["method"]]
sally[[3]]
```
all do the same thing.

But if we change the example
```{r label="list-index-five"}
names(sally)[3] <- "function"
sally[["function"]]
sally[[3]]
```
but
```
sally$function

## Error: unexpected 'function' in "sally$function"
```
`sally$function` is an error because `function` is
an R reserved word hence not a valid name (this is not an Rmarkdown
code chunk because `knitr` (which underlies `rmarkdown`)
is too clever for its own good here
and cannot just echo the actual R error message and has to make up its
own error message, which is worthless).

\pagebreak[3]
As
```{r label="list-index-six"}
sally
```
suggests,
```{r label="list-index-six-continued"}
sally$`function`
```
does work, but IMHO this is less clear than `sally[["function"]]`.

## Nit Picking about Indexing

As with `+`, indexing syntax is syntactic sugar for function calls.
```{r label="indexing-functions"}
get("[")
get("[[")
get("$")
get("[<-")
get("[[<-")
```
but, like most R users, you don't need to know these functions exist unless
you want to implement them yourself for some R class that you have created,
but before we can understand what that means we would have to learn about
the basic R OOP system (so-called S3 classes), and this is not the time for
that.

Nevertheless, this does illustrate the quotation in [Section 3.6](#objects)
above: in R 
*everything that happens is a function call,*
even things that don't look at all like function calls.

# More On Functions

The examples in [Section 4](#functions)
above illustrate most of the things that knowledgeable users of
R (what this course is trying to turn you into) do with functions.
But there is lots more to learn about functions.

## Storing Functions in Objects

One can put an anonymous function into a compound object.
```{r label="funlist"}
sally <- list(color = "red", number = pi,
    method = function(x, y) x + y)
sally$method(2, 3)
```
As we saw in [Section 5.7](#more-on-indexing) above,
one R syntax to extract a named element from a list is the `$` operator
The C++ syntax to extract a method or a field from an object is the `.`
operator.  Since both languages are about the same age, there is no reason
to think the C++ one is in any way better, even though it is more widely
copied in other languages.  This sort of looks like `sally` is a
C++-like object and `method` is a method of its class.  But R isn't
using any such notions here.  An R list can contain anything.  So it can
contain
functions.  Here `sally$method` happens to be a function.  To invoke
a function, you put its arguments in a comma-separated list in round brackets
after it.  Like the example above.

Here is another example that shows the same thing with weirder syntax.
```{r label="funlist2"}
sally[[3]](2, 3)
```
Here `sally[[3]]` is the third component of `sally`.
We invoke it in the usual way.

## Functions whose Values are Functions

Here is an example of a function returning a function.
```{r label="funval1"}
fred <- function(y) function(x) x + y
fred(2)(3)
```
Now we have gotten to the power of functional programming that makes it both
much more powerful than procedural programming languages like C++ and Java
but also very confusing to programmers trained in procedural programming.
What is going on here?

Here `fred` is a function whose value is a function.  So when we say
`fred(2)` we have invoked the function `fred` with the argument
`2` and gotten a function of one argument that adds 2 to that argument.
(One might prefer saying it adds `y` to that argument, where `y`
is the value of the argument of `fred`.  Here `y` is 2.)
So `fred(2)` is a function of one variable, that adds 2 to its argument.
We invoke it by putting its argument in parentheses after it.  Hence the above.

All very logical.  Mr. Spock or Cmdr. Data would have no trouble.  You may
have some trouble following this.

Functions like this are used in various
places in mathematics.  We can think of this `fred` as almost but not
quite the same thing as our first example of a function named `fred`
in [Section 4.3](#functions-assigned-names) above.
They do the same thing.  Both "are" functions of two arguments that add
their arguments, but "are" has to be in scare quotes because only the
first example is really a function of two arguments.
It is invoked `fred(2, 3)` just like any other R function of two
arguments.  The higher-order version is a function of one argument that returns
a function of one argument, so it is invoked `fred(2)(3)` as above.
It is almost but not quite the same.  The two functions do the same thing,
but they are not invoked in the same way.  Going from one to the other is
called [currying and uncurrying](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Currying).

This design pattern is less widely used in R than the other kind
of higher-order function (taking functions as arguments).  But there are
a few examples.  The R function `ecdf`, given a data vector, returns
the empirical cumulative distribution function (ECDF) corresponding to that
data.
What it returns is an R function that evaluates the ECDF.
The R functions `D` and `deriv` differentiate R expressions
```{r label="deriv-one"}
D(expression(x^3), "x")
D(expression(sin(x)), "x")
deriv(expression(sin(x)), "x")
```
but `deriv` can also produce a function
```{r label="deriv-two"}
deriv(expression(sin(x)), "x", function.arg = "x")
```
Readers may find these examples using `deriv` incomprehensible at this
point.  Hopefully, these will make sense after we learn more.

## Partially Evaluated Functions

Many, perhaps most, knowledgeable R users do not understand functions that
return functions,
currying, and uncurrying.  They do not need to because these techniques are
not much used in R.  But they do understand something very similar.
```{r label="funval2"}
fred <- function(x, y) x + y
fran <- function(x) fred(x, 2)
fran(3)
```
Here we have a function `fred` with two arguments `x`
and `y`, but we want to consider it a function of `x`
only for fixed `y`.  We call this new function `fran`.
This is a very useful technique.  It is widely used in mathematics.

Name the mathematical functions that correspond to the R functions
`fred` and `fran` by the letters $f$ and $g$, respectively
(because in math we usually denote functions by single letters).
What is the relationship between $f$ and $g$?  It is
$$
   g(x) = f(x, 2), \qquad \text{for all $x$}.
$$
This concept is so important that mathematicians have many ways to write it.
We could also say that the function $g$ is $f(\,\cdot\,, 2)$.
We could also say that the function $g$ is $x \mapsto f(x, 2)$.

## Some Real Nit Picking

### The Function Function

We said above the R function named `function` makes other functions,
but that is not quite correct.  If `function` were actually an R
function then typing the function name on a line by itself would tell R to
print the definition of the function.  This works with every other function,
for example,
```{r label="funname1"}
sum
```
But it doesn't work with `function`: if you type `function`
on a line by itself at the R interpreter, it just says this is not a complete
command and gives you a continuation prompt.  So `function` is actually
an R keyword (part of the syntax) rather than just the name of a function that
is defined somewhere in R.  There is actually an R function named
`function`, and it is called when expressions containing the keyword
`function` are evaluated.  To see it we can do either of the following
```{r label="funname2"}
get("function")
`function`
```
This doesn't tell us much, only that the R function named `function`
is very low level.  There is almost no R code in its definition.

### The Addition Function

Here is another definition of our first example that is very hard to read.
```{r label="funname3"}
fred <- `+`
fred(2, 3)
```
This tells us that in R *almost everything* is a function.
A lot of R syntax is \href{http://www.catb.org/jargon/html/S/syntactic-sugar.html}{syntactic sugar} for function calls.  When you write `2 + 3` in R,
what actually happens is that a function whose name is `+` and which
has two arguments is invoked with 2 and 3 as the arguments.

This illustrates again the quotation in [Section 3.6](#objects)
above: in R 
*everything that happens is a function call,*
even things that don't look at all like function calls.

### The Quit Function

Why does one type `q()` to quit R if you are using the command line
rather than a GUI?  Because the function named `q` is the function
that quits R and `q()` is calling this function with no arguments.

In R lots of things are functions that are not functions in other
programming languages.

# Still More On Functions

Before you can consider yourself a knowledgeable R user, you have to know
about

 * named arguments,
 * default values for arguments,
 * missing arguments,
 * `...` (the bit of R syntax that enables variable number of arguments)

## Named Arguments

Like in C and C++ every function argument in R has a name.  How else would
you refer to it inside the function?
Unlike in C and C++ the names of R function arguments can be used outside
the function when invoking the function.  Here's an example.
```{r label="arg-names"}
fred <- function(x, y) x^y
fred(2, 3)
fred(3, 2)
fred(x = 2, y = 3)
fred(y = 3, x = 2)
```
Again, never mind that we don't need a function to do exponentiation because
we already have the caret operator to do it.  This is just a toy function that
unlike our earlier `fred` is not a symmetric function of its arguments.

When we don't use names and reverse the order of the arguments, the value
of the function changes.
When we do use names, the order doesn't matter.  The names tell R which
argument is which, and the order is ignored.
This means users don't have to remember the order so long as they remember
(or look up in the documentation) the names.

R has a feature called *partial matching* of argument names (done by
the R function `pmatch`).  Users don't have to specify the whole
argument name, just enough to uniquely specify the argument.
```{r label="arg-names-too"}
fred <- function(xerxes, yolanda) xerxes^yolanda
fred(y = 3, x = 2)
```

## Default Values for Arguments

In an R function arguments can be given *default* values.  If the user
omits the argument, then the default is used.
```{r label="arg-defaults"}
fred <- function(xerxes = 4, yolanda = 5) xerxes^yolanda
fred()
fred(2)
fred(2, 3)
fred(yola = 3)
```

Default values for arguments can be complicated expressions.
```{r label="arg-defaults-two"}
fred <- function(x, fun1 = mean, fun2 = function(x) mean(x^2))
    fun2(x - fun1(x))
fred(1:10)
```

The above definition is so confusing that I had trouble reading it a
week after I wrote it.  The first line of the function definition is
the signature (what the arguments are) and the second line is the body.
This function calculates `fun2(x - fun1(x))`.

By default `fred(x)` calculates the variance of the empirical distribution
for data `x` (dividing by $n$ instead of $n - 1$).  But by using the
optional arguments we can calculate the median absolute deviation from the
median
```{r label="arg-defaults-three"}
fred(1:10, median, function(x) median(abs(x)))
```

Default values for arguments can also depend on other arguments.  My
first attempt at writing the function above was
```{r label="arg-defaults-four"}
fred <- function(x, mu = mean(x), fun = function(x) mean(x^2))
    fun(x - mu)
fred(1:10)
```
This shows that the default value for the second argument (`mu`)
can depend on the first argument (`x`).  The third argument does
not depend on the first argument because in `function(x) mean(x^2))`
the name `x` is the argument of the anonymous function this expression
creates.  Unfortunately, this makes a bad example because this version of
the function is harder to use, so we wouldn't actually write it this way.
```{r label="arg-defaults-five"}
fred(1:10, median(1:10), function(x) median(abs(x)))
```

For what seems to be the ultimate in R default values trickery, let us
look at the R function `svd`
```{r label="svd"}
svd
```
The defaults for arguments `nu` and `nv` depend on `n`
and `p` which don't exist when the function is invoked.  They aren't
created until lines 5 and 6 of the function body.  But this works because
R does *lazy evaluation* of function arguments.  They are not evaluated
until they are used, and `nu` and `nv` are not used until
line 9 of the function body, which is after `n` and `p` are
initialized.  All of this is explained, more or less, in the documentation
(`?svd`).

## Missing Arguments

Arguments can be missing whether or not there is a default value.
But if so, the function must either never try to use them or define
them itself.  And why would it want to do either of these?  That would
be like not having the argument at all.

But the R function `missing` allows us to do different things
in the function
depending on whether the argument is missing or not.  Here is an example
```{r label="missing"}
sample
```
It is clear that we have to use `missing` rather than a default
argument in order to do different things in case the first argument
has length one or not.

Unfortunately, this is a horrible example of really bad programming.
R does this to be backwards compatible with S, and S did it in an extremely
misguided 
attempt to be helpful.  But this is the kind of help users don't
need.  It is very surprising.  Only the most expert of users can remember
this weirdness, and they don't always remember it.  Better the
original programmer of `sample` had never thought of this trick.
This is an example you should not emulate!

There are many examples in the R code base where `missing` is used
well.  But they are complicated, and we don't want to explain them now.

## ...

The `...` syntax allows R functions to have an arbitrary number
of arguments.  For example,
```{r label="dots"}
args(list)
```
The `...` matches every argument.  This shows how you can capture
the `...` arguments if one wants to operate on them in a function
you are writing
```{r label="dots-capture"}
alice <- function(...) {
    args <- list(...)
    if (is.null(args$fred)) args$fred <- "J. Fred Muggs"
    args
}
alice(x = "foo", y = "bar")
alice(fred = 10)
```
This is the design pattern you use when you want to set a `...` argument
if the user has not set it, and otherwise want to leave it the way the
user set it.  We also see that the R idiom for testing whether a list does
not have a named element is `is.null(args$fred)`.

Whether partial matching is used on arguments that are not `...`
arguments depends on where the `...` is: named arguments
that come before `...` are partially matched, and those that come after
`...` are not partially matched.  This is so hard to remember that
many help pages, for example `optimize`, explicitly say

> Note that arguments after `...` must be matched exactly.

```{r label="dots-example"}
fred <- function(..., herman = "default")
    list(dots = list(...), herman = herman)
fred(g = 1:10, h = c("red", "orange", "yellow", "blue",
    "green", "indigo", "violet"), i = function(x) x)
```
Argument `herman` is not matched by argument `h` because
`herman` comes after `...` and so must be exactly matched.

But
```{r label="dots-example-two"}
fred <- function(herman = "default", ...)
    list(dots = list(...), herman = herman)
fred(g = 1:10, h = c("red", "orange", "yellow", "blue",
    "green", "indigo", "violet"), i = function(x) x)
```
Now argument `herman` is matched by argument `h` because
`herman` comes before `...` and so may be partially matched.

There are probably many uses of `...` that I have never thought of.
The two main uses are

 * to allow the function to work on a variable number
    of arguments (like the R function `list` and many other R functions),
    and
 * to pass arguments to another function (like the R function
    `optimize` and many other R functions).

From `?optimize`, in the "Usage" section
```
     optimize(f, interval, ..., lower = min(interval),
              upper = max(interval), maximum = FALSE,
              tol = .Machine$double.eps^0.25)
     optimise(f, interval, ..., lower = min(interval),
              upper = max(interval), maximum = FALSE,
              tol = .Machine$double.eps^0.25)
```
(R allows either American or British spelling for this function name)
and later on in the "Arguments" section
```
     ...: additional named or unnamed arguments to be
              passed to ‘f’.
```

### A Long Example (Maximum Likelihood Estimation)

Suppose we want to do maximum likelihood estimation
for the gamma distribution with unknown shape parameter and known
scale parameter, which we take to be the R default value.
```{r label=mle}
# make up true unknown parameter value ("simulation truth")
alpha <- pi
# make up sample size
n <- 30
# make up data, set RNG seed to get same data every time
set.seed(42)
x <- rgamma(n, shape = alpha)
# log likelihood function
logl <- function(alpha, x)
    sum(dgamma(x, shape = alpha, log = TRUE))
# need interval to optimize over, true "unknown" parameter
# value should be in interval mean(x) + or - 3 * sd(x)
# because E(X) = alpha
interval <- mean(x) + c(-1, 1) * 3 * sd(x)
# but have to not allow non-positive parameter values
interval <- pmax(mean(x) / 1e3, interval)
# maximize the log likelihood
oout <- optimize(logl, maximum = TRUE, interval, x = x)
oout$maximum
mean(x)
```
The point of showing both the maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) and the
sample mean, both of which are consistent and asymptotically normal estimators
of the unknown parameter $\alpha$, is just to show that they are different.

A plot of the log likelihood done by the following code
```{r label=fig2plot,eval=FALSE}
mylogl <- Vectorize(function(alpha) logl(alpha, x))
curve(mylogl, from = interval[1], to = interval[2],
    xlab=expression(alpha), ylab=expression(logl(alpha)))
```
```{r label=fig2, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Graph of Log Likelihood", fig.align="center"}
mylogl <- Vectorize(function(alpha) logl(alpha, x))
curve(mylogl, from = interval[1], to = interval[2],
    xlab=expression(alpha), ylab=expression(logl(alpha)))
```
shows that the optimization seems to have worked.  The tricks needed to
draw this curve we do not want to explain right now.

All of that is interesting, and we will go over it in detail at some
point in the course.  But in this section, the only point that is
interesting is how we are using the `...` argument to `optimize`.
The R function `optimize` does not have an argument named `x`
or even an argument that comes before `...` in the argument list
that can be partially matched to `x` (from the documentation quoted
above only the arguments `f` and `interval` come before
`...` and neither begins with `x`).  Thus `optimize`
considers `x` a `...` argument and passes it to `f`
when `f` is called (many times) from inside `optimize` to evaluate
the function being maximized (that is `logl` which is called `f`
inside `optimize`).  When `optimize` calls `f` it does
it by defining an anonymous function
```
function(arg) f(arg, ...)
```
(typing `optimize` at the R command line shows you its definition)
and since we know that in this case `...` matches only the argument
`x = x`, this is the same as defining the objective function to be
```
function(arg) f(arg, x = x)
```
or, since `f` is another name for `logl`, as
```
function(arg) logl(arg, x = x)
```

Note that here the R function `optimize` is using the trick
of "partially evaluated functions" explained in
[Section 6.3](#partially-evaluated-functions) above.
It takes the given function,
which it calls `f` and which can have many arguments, and converts
it to an anonymous function of one argument.  It passes this to a C function
named `do_fmin` to actually do the optimization, so we cannot see how
that works without reading the C source code for R, which we won't bother
with.  The point is that this C function only needs to know how maximize
R functions of one variable.  It doesn't need to know about any other
variables.

### Alternative Solution for that Long Example

The preceding section shows the approved (in some circles) way to do that
problem.

But here is another way (that some people deem evil and stupid).
Just define `logl` as a function of one variable.
```{r label="mle-logl-alt"}
logl <- function(alpha)
    sum(dgamma(x, shape = alpha, log = TRUE))
```
and then do the optimization as before except now we omit the
`x = x`.
```{r label="mle-optimize-alt"}
oout <- optimize(logl, maximum = TRUE, interval)
oout$maximum
```

How does that work?  How does `logl` when called from within
`optimize` find out what `x` is?

The short answer is that it looks it up in the R global environment
(which is where we defined it in the first place).  So it works.
And we didn't need `x = x`.

And now for the caution about this method.
[Global variables are evil](http://wiki.c2.com/?GlobalVariablesAreBad).
(An interesting bit of computing history:
Wiki Wiki Web was the first Wiki that Wikipedia and zillions of other wikis
copy
([Wikipedia entry Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wiki&oldid=752613214)).

In serious work, global variables should never be used.
Especially, they should never
be used in code that you make for others to use.  What if you call the data
`x` inside your function and the user calls the data `y` outside
your function.  That won't work.  But if the `...` trick is used, then
the user can still call the data `y` and make the argument to match
`x` via the `...` mechanism `x = y`, that is, the argument
named `x` (in the function you wrote) is the data named `y`
(outside the function)
by the user.

So put `logl` back the way it was originally
```{r label="logl-original"}
logl <- function(alpha, x)
    sum(dgamma(x, shape = alpha, log = TRUE))
```
and now call the data `y`
```{r label="x-is-y"}
y <- x
rm(x) # now x is gone
```
and
```{r label="mle-optimize-original"}
oout <- optimize(logl, maximum = TRUE, interval, x = y)
oout$maximum
```
still works.

In short, *don't use global variables*.  Except.  The Perl slogan is
TIMTOWTDI (there is more than one way to do it), pronounced tim-toady
([Wikipedia entry](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=There%27s_more_than_one_way_to_do_it&oldid=754047450)).
This could also be an R slogan.  There is no one true
way to use R.  There are many ways of R.  As we said above, the way of
this problem that uses global variables is the simplest, easiest, and most
R-ish for one-off uses when the programmer and the user are one.

You only need to avoid global variables to be politically correct in the
computer science sense (as the Wiki Wiki Web page cited above explains)
or to have your code usable by others (including your future self six
months from now).

# Stop Me before I Crash and Burn

There is a very old computer slogan GIGO (garbage in, garbage out)
([Wikipedia entry](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Garbage_in,_garbage_out&oldid=740536906))
that goes back to the 1950's.  There is a more modern
meaning *garbage in, gospel out* that refers to people believing
anything that comes from a computer no matter how ridiculous (the internet
is never wrong).

Another R slogan could be *garbage in, error messages out* (GIEMO)
R functions should not allow users to shoot themselves in the foot.
They should not be *footguns*.
This is unlike some languages we know

> Within C++, there is a much smaller and cleaner language struggling to get
> out. 
>
> --- Bjarne Stroustrup
>
> C makes it easy to shoot yourself in the foot; C++ makes it harder,

>
> --- Bjarne Stroustrup 

Since so much of R is functions, if none of the functions are footguns,
then the whole language is not a footgun (almost).  Of course, some R
functions are footguns, such as the notorious `sample` mentioned
above ([Section 7.3](#missing-arguments)) and the notorious `[` function
also mentioned above ([Section 5.4](#indexing)) but without mentioning
its footgun behavior, which involves matrices (and will be explained
in the [next handout](http://www.stat.umn.edu/geyer/3701/notes/array.html#the-square-brackets-function-is-a-footgun)).
But the vast majority of R functions are not footguns because they follow
GIEMO.  The first job of a good R function that is usable by humans who
make mistakes is to check that no errors are possible.  In order to not
be a footgun our log likelihood function in
[Section 7.4.1](#a-long-example-maximum-likelihood-estimation) above should
have been something like
```{r label="logl-giemo"}
logl <- function(alpha, x) {
    stopifnot(is.numeric(alpha))
    stopifnot(is.finite(alpha))
    stopifnot(length(alpha) == 1)
    stopifnot(alpha > 0)
    stopifnot(is.numeric(x))
    stopifnot(is.finite(x))
    stopifnot(x > 0)
    sum(dgamma(x, shape = alpha, log = TRUE))
}
```
Of course, since `dgamma` is not a footgun, you can rely on it to
catch some of these errors.  But you should not.  You should catch them
yourself, for the following reasons.

 * Just from looking at our code, we can tell our function is not a footgun.
 * If we look at the R code for `dgamma`, we see that it hardly
    checks anything and instead leaves these checks for the C function it calls
    to do the work.
 * Reading the C source code is hard.
 * Actually, a lot more than hard.  We just don't want to go there.

Let's check that it still works.
```{r label="mle-optimize-giemo"}
oout <- optimize(logl, maximum = TRUE, interval, x = y)
oout$maximum
```

# Control-Flow Constructs

## If-Then-Else

R has loops and if-then-else, but they behave quite differently from C and C++.

For one thing, like everything else in the R language, they are expressions.
We have already seen this
in [Section 5.3.2](#reduce) above where we used `if (x > y) x else y`
as part of a larger expression.  You can't do that in C or C++.

## For

For another thing `for` loops in R iterate over the elements of a vector
or list.  They do not do arithmetic on indices.  In this they work more like
so-called for-each loops in Java or C++ (more on this below).

Thus, while the C or C++ or Java
```
for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    // do case i
}
```
does have an R equivalent
```
for (i in 1:n) {
    # do case i
}
```
the R is different in that it does not do any arithmetic on `i`
and `1:n` is just a vector of integers like any other place `1:n`
is used in R.

R also has the following.  Suppose `todo` is a list of some sort(s)
of R objects, then
```
for (o in todo) {
    # process object o
}
```
iterates over elements of this list.  This is what we mean by the `for`
control-flow construct in R being more like for-each in Java or C++
(and like nothing in C).

Beginners who have been brainwashed in languages like C or C++ are tempted
to treat `for` in R like `for` in C or C++, writing the last
example with indices
```
for (i in 1:length(todo)) {
    o <- todo[[i]]
    # process object o
}
```
This works, of course, but it is clumsy and inelegant.  Don't use indices
unless you have to, for example, when processing several vectors of the
same length in parallel.

Just for our own amusement (readers can skip to the end of this subsection
and not miss anything about R) we look at the Java and C++ for-each code.
In Java if `todo` is an object of a class `Foo` that implements
the `Iterable<Foo>` interface, then
```
for (Foo o : todo) {
    // process object o
}
```
does the same thing as the R for loop above.  The C++ analog looks just the
same except that the description of what `todo` has to be in order
for this to work is so complicated that I cannot figure out any way to condense
it here.

## Repeat

Because R does not have the C and C++ kind of `for`, the R `for`
cannot be used to write an infinite loop (that one leaves by
using the `break` statement).
The C or C++ idiom is
```
for (;;) {
    // each time through the loop decide if we are ready
    // to leave using a break statement
}
```
The R equivalent is
```
repeat {
    # each time through the loop decide if we are ready
    # to leave using a break expression
}
```

Sometimes you need loops.  Often you don't.  We didn't feel the need for
any actual examples in this document.  We will avoid them whenever we can
in this course.  Knowledgeable R users know that loops should be avoided
when possible, whether or not they have the knowledge to actually avoid
loops in any particular case.

# An Extended Example

## The Problem

Write a function that does Winsorized means.  This is defined as replace
$x$ of the data from each end with the closest data value that is not removed
and then average.

## The Design

That is not enough of a problem statement.  We need a more careful statement
before we start coding.  What values of $x$ are allowed?  Obviously we cannot
remove more than all of the data so we must have $0 < x \le 0.5$.

But we can't remove all of the data either, because otherwise
"the closest data value that is not removed" makes no sense.
So we must have $x < 0.5$.

If there are an odd number of data points, then in order to keep at least one
data point, we must have $x < (n - 1) / (2 n)$.
If there are an even number of data points, then in order to keep at least one
data point, in which case we must actually keep two because of symmetry,
we must have $x < (n - 2) / (2 n)$.

What if there are zero data points?  How should we define the mean of zero
data points?  What does R do in this case?
```{r label="mean-zero"}
mean(double())
```
Presumably we should do the same thing for this case.

What if there are missing data or "not a number" data?
```{r label="mean-na"}
mean(NA)
mean(NaN)
```
Presumably we should do the same thing for these cases.

Thus our function should look something like this
```{r label="our-func-one"}
winsorizedMean <- function(x, winsorize = 0.2) {
    stopifnot(is.numeric(x))
    stopifnot(is.numeric(winsorize))
    stopifnot(length(winsorize) == 1)
    stopifnot(0 < winsorize & winsorize < 0.5)
    n <- length(x)
    if (n == 0) return(NaN)
    if (anyNA(x)) return(NaN)
    # now calculate the Winsorized mean of x in the case where
    # we know length(x) > 0 and there are no NA or NaN in x
}
```
That takes care of the GIEMO issue.

It does not agree with our previous design decision to return `NA`
if there are `NA` in the input.  This is because
```{r label="our-func-anyNA"}
anyNA(NA)
anyNA(NaN)
```
does not distinguish between `NA` and `NaN`.

We had never heard of the function `anyNA` before writing this example.
We found it discussed on the help page for `is.na`.

Before we can adjust the data, we need it in sorted order because $x$
at each end implicitly refers to the data in sorted order (as laid out
on the number line).  There is an R function `sort` that does that.
Looking at the help page for that, we see that there is a faster function
`sort.int` that does partial sorting to make it even faster.
Partial sorting seems to be just what we need here.  `?sort` says

> If `partial` is not `NULL`, it is taken to contain indices of
> elements of the result which are to be placed in their correct
> positions in the sorted array by partial sorting.  For each of the

If we do a partial sort that gets the two components that we use to replace
other components correctly, then we can calculate the Winsorized mean.

So what are those indices?  We are supposed to trim
`n * winsorize` from each end.  But that may not be a round number.
We need to round that down to find our how many data values to Winsorize
at each end.  And how do we round?  The help page `?round` describes
many functions that do rounding.  Reading their descriptions tells us
that `floor` rounds down.

So if we define
```
k <- floor(n * winsorize)
```
then the check
```
k < n / 2
```
will do the job of making sure that we have at least one non-replaced data
value.  Then we want to do a partial sort getting the indices `k + 1`
and `n - k` correct.

And then what do we do?  We could do the replacement, but we could also
just do the arithmetic without doing the replacement
```
(k + 1) * (x[k + 1] + x[n - k]) + sum(x[seq(k + 2, n - k - 1)])
```
divided by `n` is the Winsorized mean, except when
`k + 2` > `n - k - 1`, in which case we should be taking the sum
of an empty set of numbers (that is, zero) but the R function `seq`
produces the sequence that goes *down* from `k + 2`
to `n - k - 1` in this case, so that won't work.
So we have to special case this.

## The Implementation

This leaves us with
```{r label="our-func-final"}
winsorizedMean <- function(x, winsorize = 0.2) {
    stopifnot(is.numeric(x))
    stopifnot(is.numeric(winsorize))
    stopifnot(length(winsorize) == 1)
    stopifnot(0 < winsorize & winsorize < 0.5)
    n <- length(x)
    if (n == 0) return(NaN)
    if (anyNA(x)) return(NaN)

    k <- floor(n * winsorize)
    if (k >= n / 2) stop("winsorize too large")
    if (k == 0) return(mean(x))
    x <- sort.int(x, partial = c(k + 1, n - k))
    if (k + 2 >= n - k - 1)
        return(mean(x[c(k + 1, n - k)]))
    else
        return ((k + 1) * (x[k + 1] + x[n - k]) +
            sum(x[seq(k + 2, n - k - 1)])) / n
}
```

## Testing

Once we have an implementation, we are about half done.  Now we need to
test it to see that it works *correctly*.  And if we were putting this
in an R package we were writing, we would also have to write a good help
page.

The tests should test all the behavior, including that it gives the right
errors under the right conditions.
```{r label="test-one",error=TRUE}
winsorizedMean("fred")
winsorizedMean(double())
winsorizedMean(NA)
winsorizedMean(NaN)
winsorizedMean(1:10, 0.6)
winsorizedMean(1:10, "fred")
winsorizedMean(1:10, 1:10)
winsorizedMean(1:10, -3)
```

OK, except we did not get the result expected when the input was `NA`.
A look at the help page for `NA` tells us that the trouble is that
there are NA values of each atomic vector type except `raw` and the default
type is `logical`.  So try again.
```{r label="test-two"}
winsorizedMean(NA_real_)
winsorizedMean(c(1.1, 2.2, NA))
```
OK.

Now how do we get the "winsorize too large" error message?
We actually cannot get that (I think).  If `winsorize` is
less than $1/2$, then `k` should be less than `n / 2`.

I confess that when I was writing this code, I forgot to put in checks
that the `winsorize` argument was OK when I first wrote this function.
Without those checks, the check about `k >= n / 2` does do something
important.  While I was writing these tests, I realized I should be checking
whether both arguments were wrong, and went back and inserted checks for
the `winsorize` argument.  So now the check about `k >= n / 2` does
nothing as far as I can see, but I left it in the code, because it
does check a condition that we need to be true in order for the function to
work correctly.  So if our analysis that it can never be triggered is wrong,
it is there to save us.

Now we need to test each code path that calculates a non-error result.
There are three of them.
```{r label="test-three"}
# make up some data
x <- rnorm(20)
identical(winsorizedMean(x, 0.001), mean(x))
```
So the path where the Winsorized mean is just the mean seems to work.

When do we have `k + 2 >= n - k - 1`?  We have equality when
$$
   2 k = n - 3
$$
and this means $n$ must be odd.  With our even-length data, we have
$(n - 3) / 2 = 17 / 2 = 8.5$ and $k$ is greater than that when $k = 9$.
And that should happen when `winsorize` is greater than $9 / 20$.
```{r label="test-four"}
identical(winsorizedMean(x, 0.499), median(x))
```
The reason why this test works is that in both cases the function is
returning the average of the two middle values.

Now for the last case, which does something really complicated and tricky.
How do we test that?  My answer, developed over long experience in programming
in R and C and many other languages, is that we redo the calculation in the
least tricky, most straightforward way possible, a way that is hopefully
obviously correct.  If we get the same answers both ways, we appear to be
good.
```{r label="test-five"}
w1 <- winsorizedMean(x)
sx <- sort(x)
ilow <- seq(along = x) < length(x) * 0.2
ihig <- seq(along = x) > length(x) * 0.8
x.nonrep <- sx[! (ilow & ihig)]
sx[ilow] <- min(x.nonrep)
sx[ihig] <- max(x.nonrep)
w2 <- mean(sx)
identical(w1, w2)
```
What happened?
```{r label="test-five-and-a-half"}
w1 - w2
```

It looks like our function is broken.  But it may be that the test is wrong.
So first we test the test.
```{r label="test-five-and-three-quarters"}
sort(x)
sx
```
Our "hopefully obviously correct" method was wrong.  Here we have
$n * `winsorize` = 20 \times 0.2 = 4$, so we should replace the
four lowest values with the fifth lowest.  And we certainly did not do that.

But first let us check that we are not making another mistake.
```{r label="test-six"}
floor(length(x) * 0.2)
```
OK.  At least our analysis that we should be replacing the four lowest and
four highest is correct (despite inexactness of computer arithmetic).
```{r label="test-six-point-one"}
ilow
ihig
```
Clearly, we wanted `<=` rather than `<` in our definitions of these.
```{r label="test-six-point-two"}
ilow <- seq(along = x) <= length(x) * 0.2
ihig <- seq(along = x) >= length(x) * 0.8
ilow
ihig
```
If you so the arithmetic counting on your fingers, $20 \times 0.8 = 16$, so
R is right, and my notion that this should do the Right Thing is Wrong.
Try again.
```{r label="test-six-point-three"}
ihig <- rev(ilow)
ihig
```
So now those are right.
```{r label="test-six-point-four"}
sx <- sort(x)
sx
x.nonrep <- sx[! (ilow & ihig)]
x.nonrep
```

Oops!  That was just dumb.  I guess I needed a logical or rather than logical
and or maybe just the parentheses in different places.
```{r label="test-six-point-five"}
x.nonrep <- sx[(! ilow) & (! ihig)]
x.nonrep
```
OK.  Now for the rest of the check.
```{r label="test-six-point-six"}
sx[ilow] <- min(x.nonrep)
sx[ihig] <- max(x.nonrep)
w2 <- mean(sx)
identical(w1, w2)
```
What happened?
```{r label="test-six-point-seven"}
w1 - w2
```
so it is not just inexactness of computer arithmetic.
```{r label="test-six-point-eight"}
sort(x)
sx
```
That sure looks like what we are supposed to average to calculate the
Winsorized mean.  So now that we think the check is right, it appears
that our function is buggy.

So now we have to debug it.
```{r label="test-debug-one"}
n <- length(x)
winsorize <- 0.2
k <- floor(n * winsorize)
k
myx <- sort.int(x, partial = c(k + 1, n - k))
myx
w3 <- (k + 1) * (myx[k + 1] + x[n - k]) +
            sum(myx[seq(k + 2, n - k - 1)]) / n
identical(w1, w3)
```
Oh!  In copying this code from the function definition, I found an error.
A parenthesis was out of place.

## Re-Implementation

```{r label="our-func-final-too"}
winsorizedMean <- function(x, winsorize = 0.2) {
    stopifnot(is.numeric(x))
    stopifnot(is.numeric(winsorize))
    stopifnot(length(winsorize) == 1)
    stopifnot(0 < winsorize & winsorize < 0.5)
    n <- length(x)
    if (n == 0) return(NaN)
    if (anyNA(x)) return(NaN)

    k <- floor(n * winsorize)
    if (k >= n / 2) stop("winsorize too large")
    if (k == 0) return(mean(x))
    x <- sort.int(x, partial = c(k + 1, n - k))
    if (k + 2 >= n - k - 1)
        return(mean(x[c(k + 1, n - k)]))
    else
        return(((k + 1) * (x[k + 1] + x[n - k]) +
            sum(x[seq(k + 2, n - k - 1)])) / n)
}
```
Actually, I realized I had more than one parenthesis mistake in the last
expression.  Hopefully, this works.

## Re-Test

```{r label="retest-one"}
w1 <- winsorizedMean(x)
identical(w1, w2)
w1 - w2
all.equal(w1, w2)
```
We should have remembered the slogan

> Never test objects of type `"double"` for equality!  Use the
> R function `all.equal` instead (which tests for close to equal,
> using an optional argument `tolerance` to say how close).

So our function works.

And we also have to do all the rest of the tests.
```{r label="retest-two",error=TRUE}
winsorizedMean("fred")
winsorizedMean(double())
winsorizedMean(NA_real_)
winsorizedMean(NaN)
winsorizedMean(1:10, 0.6)
winsorizedMean(1:10, "fred")
winsorizedMean(1:10, 1:10)
winsorizedMean(1:10, -3)
identical(winsorizedMean(x, 0.001), mean(x))
identical(winsorizedMean(x, 0.499), median(x))
```

I was happy with this for a day or two, but then I started to wonder about
the definition of the sample median being different for even and odd sample
sizes.  Is this still OK for odd $n$?
```{r label="retest-three",error=TRUE}
x <- rnorm(21)
winsorizedMean("fred")
winsorizedMean(double())
winsorizedMean(NA_real_)
winsorizedMean(NaN)
winsorizedMean(1:10, 0.6)
winsorizedMean(1:10, "fred")
winsorizedMean(1:10, 1:10)
winsorizedMean(1:10, -3)
identical(winsorizedMean(x, 0.001), mean(x))
identical(winsorizedMean(x, 0.499), median(x))
w1 <- winsorizedMean(x)
sx <- sort(x)
ilow <- seq(along = x) <= length(x) * 0.2
ihig <- rev(ilow)
x.nonrep <- sx[(! ilow) & (! ihig)]
sx[ilow] <- min(x.nonrep)
sx[ihig] <- max(x.nonrep)
w2 <- mean(sx)
identical(w1, w2)
```
